# Final Project Description

The final project is very open-ended, and there are no specific requirements for what your final project does per se. There will be 100 overall points awarded as follows:

- **30 points:** Having a front end that is interactive and event-driven
- **30 points:** Having a back end that serves at least two resources with a RESTful CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) API.
- **10 points:** Uses at least one 3rd party API
- **10 points:** Uses session-persistent state in some way. For example, authenticating the user and then having user-specific preferences and/or data.
- **10 points:** A pleasing user experience (i.e., easy to use, good design, etc.).
- **10 points:** Quality of presentation video (see below)

Each group will be expected to turn in their final projects as a repository with all of the code, stylesheets, images, and any other files developed as part of their project with a top-level README.md file that briefly describes their project and includes a link to a presentation video.

## Project Description

Our final project is a Weather Application that allows users to create an account, sign in, and choose cities to check the weather for (using a 3rd party API). Users may also choose to save their chosen cities for ease of access when they sign in again (using a db).
